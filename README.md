Digikey Payloads


The digikey was cool (and super small) but it seems that an external driver must be installed in order for Win10 to work. still cool to mess around with.
I think 2 of the 4 may be dupes, probably out dated. But I wanted to put them somewhere to remeber. 

Honestly, I recommend writing you're own as they are not very difficult. An easier way is taking premade ducky script and using digiQuack. Just need to test and make adjustments as it is not always 100% successful.
